examples part three 

hello, I have made a little update of my lionparser (mini interpreter)
32-bit and 64-bit tested.  compiled with freebasic 1.10.1.  win 10/11.
new built in feature ulong and longInt datatypes. 
fixed features: for while wend if else elseif endif etc..

regards, loewenherz

these examples are working now:


' 1)
Dim as integer x 
x= 2
if x = 1 then
    print "x=1"
elseif x = 2 then
    print "x=2"
elseif x = 3 then
    print "x=3"
else
    print "x unknown"
endif
print "fertig"
for i = 1 To 10
    Print i
next i
Print i
Run



' 2)

dim as integer x 
x = 0
while x < 3
    if x = 1 then
        print "x=1 inside while"
    elseif x = 2 then
        print "x=2 inside while"
    else
        print "x=other inside while"
    endif
    x = x + 1
wend
run



dim as integer i
for i = 1 to 3
    print "for loop i=" + i
next
run

'
'3)

 function multi(a as integer, b as integer) as integer
 return a * b
 endfunction
 print multi(4,6) 
 run

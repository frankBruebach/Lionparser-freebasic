hello, I have made last weeks a big update for my parser, "lionparser", now it's getting more a little interpreter.
some example I have add to below how to make the parser run.
only lower case input it's possible at the moment for console modus.
you can load simple files too with #include "test.bas" or "test.bi".
functions are running also, zstring handling, wstring, integer, double, long, string and much more...
if you like this project you can test the lionparser.

the lionparser.exe file for 32-bit and 64-bit you can find at github here and source code too.



thanks, loewenherz
